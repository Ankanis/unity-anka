ink is needed before you can make your own dialogues

Go install ink here -> https://www.inklestudios.com/ink/

to make dialogues, go to DIALOGUES folder -> Create (right click) -> Ink 

Modify the ink file using the ink program, and use the other file to use as the txt asset

And yes, I just did follow a tutorial for this

some dialogue system assets from the asset store are far better than this (less cluttered too)
lmk if u dont mind that instead
